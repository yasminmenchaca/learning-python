"""In creating Echo Chatbot, you’re already implementing some patterns that you’ll use as you develop more complex chatbot programs:

Greeting a user.
Informing the user that they are interacting with a bot (and not a human).
Instructing the user on how to interact with the bot.
Accepting user input.
Setting up output that is dependent on user input."""
